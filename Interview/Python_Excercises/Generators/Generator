Iterating over a large data set is memory intense operation.

Eg: Ticketing counter -> You dont want pile of tickets lying and pick one by one.
                         instead you want one by one



Range vs Xrange:

Range ->  returns a list of objects to loop through - it stores the entire list of objects in memory
Xrange -> supports lazy evaluation
          It returns a single object at a time - and stores a single object into memory
          Its a generator


Iterators are objects that support Next() method -> which grabs items one at a time


A generator is a iterator, not vice versa.

There it evaluates one at a time, without storing entire thing in memory
