We use the Builder pattern when we know that an object must be created in multiple steps, and different representations of the same construction are required.

The main difference is that a Factory pattern creates an object in a single step, whereas a Builder pattern creates an object in multiple steps, and almost always through the use of a director.

Thus, complex objects involving multiple steps are built using builder and director provides the exact representation.
