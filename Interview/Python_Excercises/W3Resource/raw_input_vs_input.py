# raw_input() or input() both are ways of accepting user input from command prompt

# Raw input takes whatever user types and returns the string, But is replaced by input in python 3.0

# Input takes the input and evaluates it.

# "Name you enter must be in quotes here, but In raw_input you can just type as raw without quotes"

name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you " + name + "!")
