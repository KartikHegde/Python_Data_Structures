Closures
Closures are nothing but functions that are returned by another function. We use closures to remove code duplication. In the following example we create a simple closure for adding numbers.

>>> def add_number(num):
...     def adder(number):
...         'adder is a closure'
...         return num + number
...     return adder
...
>>> a_10 = add_number(10)
>>> a_10(21)
31
>>> a_10(34)
44
>>> a_5 = add_number(5)
>>> a_5(3)
8
adder is a closure which adds a given number to a pre-defined one.
