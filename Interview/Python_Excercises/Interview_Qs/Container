Containers
Containers are data structures holding elements, and that support membership tests. They are data structures that live in memory, and typically hold all their values in memory, too. In Python, some well known examples are:

list, deque, …
set, frozensets, …
dict, defaultdict, OrderedDict, Counter, …
tuple, namedtuple, …
str
Containers are easy to grasp, because you can think of them as real life containers: a box, a cubboard, a house, a ship, etc.
