Program : set of instructions -> but its a static code

Process : When program is under execution or after execution , its called process.

It has its own set of instructions and own logic space.

Thread : Its part of the process and controls a unit of code in the process

It has its own set of instructions but
shares the same logic space as that of other threads in process.

Threads inside the process can share the data bw them.

the problem occurs here as, 2 or more threads can access the data at same time.

Note : Main is also a thread.

Eg: 1. hashing 100 passwords

    2. File download in backend, and UI in frontend
