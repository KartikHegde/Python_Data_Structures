__name__ == "__main__"

to make sure you are running the current file from python interpreter not the imported one.

imported files are given the __ name __ == name of the imported file


imported code always runs first. so any print statemenet from imported file gets executed first.

but if the code is inside any of the main() in the first Eg: def main():
																Main()

															-> then it wont get execured in second file

because in second file, imported first file name is first_file. so import wont run
