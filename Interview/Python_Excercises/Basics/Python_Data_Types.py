# In Python, every value has a datatype,
# but we don't need to declare the datatype of variables. ' \
# How does that work? Based on each variable's original assignment, '
# Python figures out what type it is and keeps tracks of that internally.


# Python is dynamically typed, however, it is also strongly typed
