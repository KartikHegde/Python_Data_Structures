Package -> is a directory containing python module + __init__ file

Module   -> containing python source code

importing is easy when you have package.
Otherwise you cant import from directory. i.e if you have a directory say Bank -> and 2 files
Account + main. Main cant import account as its directory.

Make it package to import and instantiate it.

Note: You need to use from filename import class name you want to instantiate.
