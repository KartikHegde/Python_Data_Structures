Note: Bitwise operations are done always only on integers.

xor or nor operations will flip the bits.

And and Or operations can be used to mask specific bits.

A diff class representation is given under LC - no of 1 bits and PS - no of 0 and 1 -> problems

Note: Integers are represented as decimal no systems with base 10.
